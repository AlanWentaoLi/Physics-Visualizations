This is a visualisation to help students visualise and understand the movement of the gyroscope. 
There are 3 pages: A theory page, a simple gyroscope movement page, and a page where the student 
can play around with the parameters affecting the motion. 

Instructions (functions and decisions):

Theory page:

initPlot_gyro : plotting the vector diagram in the theory section

2nd page:

reset: resets all the variables and draws the gyroscope at its initial position  
toggle: changing the button name and calls play() function every 10 milliseconds to draw the gyrocope
play: function that makes a plot of the gyroscope that changes every time it is called (because parameters are t dependent and the variable t is changed every loop)
calc: generates the positions of the points which are passed into the handle_slider function to be plotted
handle_slider: plots the points of the gyroscope whenever the value of the slider is changed
initialize: makes the first plot of the gyroscope when the page is loaded.

3rd page:
inertia_decision: if played = true the inertia is changed during the animation
reset: resets all parameters to their initial values and plots the gyro in its initial position
speed_toggle: this is a button to speed up/slow down
toggle: changing the button text and starting/stopping the gyro
play: plots the gyroscope (with a parameter t that changes, so the gyroscope position changes with time)
handle_slider: plots the new points of the gyroscope whenever the value of the slider is changed
initial: initially plotting the gyroscope when the page is loaded


Possible improvements for the gyroscope visualisations:

Future:
-Addition of user visualisation guidance (if judged relevant)
-Addition of A graph of PE, KE and total energy over time - 
-Tracking the other graphs over time
-Addition of friction slider

Ones I can feasibly do within this week/next:
-formatting the website
-adding vectors
-Developing of the theory - addition of more preceding pages with simpler theory
 e.g a gif of the gyroscope
- adding a friction and non-friction gyroscope
 
Possible outstanding bugs:
