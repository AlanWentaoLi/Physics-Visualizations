    <p >Consider a precessing gyroscope that is just about to touch the floor. The diagram above is an overhead view of the angular momentum vector.
        If we use the formula linking arc length, radius and angle subtended, we find:
         $ Arc$ $length$ = $Radius$ * $Angle$ $subtended$
    <p></p> <!--align = left-->
        Then, at constant radius, for very small amplitudes:
     $ d(Arc$ $length) $ = $ Arc$ $radius $ * $ d(Angle$ $subtended)$
      so we obtain: (dividing both sides by dt)
    </p>
            $$ \dot{L}(t)= L\dot{\theta(t)} $$
            <p>Realizing that $\dot{L}(t) = Rmg$, $L = Iw$,  and $\dot{\theta(t)} = \omega_{precession}$, we find:</p>
            $$
                 \omega_{precession} = \frac{Rmg}{Iw}
            $$
    (Note: Precession means rotation about the z axis, not the gyroscope's own axis.)

            <p align="justify">From this formula, we can see that the larger the moment of inertia of the flywheel about the rod passing through it ($I$), at constant mass ($m$), the slower the rate of precession.

    From the diagram, the torque experienced by the gyroscope is in a direction perpendicular to it's angular momentum.
    This means the change in angular momentum, in the same direction as the torque, is also perpendicular to it's own axis (recall that torque is the rate of change of angular momentum).
    </p><p>
    As a result the angular momentum vector of the gyroscope begins to "follow" the torque; so the gyroscope itself begins to move around in a circle about the z axis, in the direction of the torque.
    Without friction, the gyroscope does not "drop" as the angular momentum and torque both stay the same direction and magnitude.
</p>
</p><p></p><p>

    In the presence of air resistance, as the gyroscope wheel slows down due to friction, decreasing $\omega$, the angular momentum of the gyroscope ($I\omega$) decreases.
    From the equation, the precession rate $ \omega_{precession} $ increases.
        </p><p>
    In physical terms, the torque ($R \times mg$) remains largely the same (at the same angle to the vertical) but the change in angular momentum due to the torque is larger in comparison to the angular momentum of the gyroscope ($I\omega$).
    As a result, the gyroscope "follows" the torque at a faster rate. The loss in gravitational potential of the gyro as it falls provides energy for its precession.
</p><p>
    <!--
    Initially, when the gyroscope begins to fall down, it loses some gravitational potential energy which supplies kinetic energy for its' precession. If the loss of angular momentum of the flywheel about the rod, due to frictional forces acting on the wheel, can be neglected,
    then we can explain the deviation of the gyroscope's rotation axis (about it's rod) away from the z-axis (where it was initially) to balance the increase in angular momentum about the z axis due to the precession about the z axis,
    so that the angular momentum about the z axis would be conserved. If there were no frictional forces, the angular momentum about the z axis would be totally conserved as it is always perpendicular to the torque.
