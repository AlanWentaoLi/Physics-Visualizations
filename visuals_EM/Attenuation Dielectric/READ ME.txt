Attenuation in Dielectrics:

The visulistion suite aims to show the exponential decay of the amplitude of waves in dielectrics as a function of their 
angular frequency, specifically how an increasing imaginary componant of the refractive index produces a larger exponential
decay.

Single Wave:

The Wave class used to produce the waves is adapted from a previous visulisation created in Python, which has been translated
with an attenuation method introduced to produc the required decay.

Plane Wave:

The surface plot within plotly requires a square matrix for the z-axis, hence sine waves along a specific y-axis value are 
created with the wavelength of these determined by the angle of incidence/reflection/refraction. The opacity of the dielctric
material provides a qualatative visulisation of the real refractive index of the material.
