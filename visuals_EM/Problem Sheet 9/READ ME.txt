Problem Sheet 9:

The visulisation aims to show the counter intuitive result that complete transmission of energy may occur with a very high
reflection coefficient, if the dielectric thickness is of the correct width.

The first wave (the incident reflected and tranmitted) are created seperatly initially as the rest of the waves are simply
looped over as the reflected waves bounce inside the dielectric (with decreasing amplitude).
